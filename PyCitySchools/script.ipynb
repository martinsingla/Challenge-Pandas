Actually, there are not many schools with overall % of passing students between 55% and 90%. School performance in the district is very polarized!! Maybe some correlation statistics and regression analysis using budget per student data will help further understand this trend."

    "Interestingly enough, there seems to be a negative correlation between budget per student groups and average student performance per shcool.

School budget allocation may not be directly related to the amount of students studying in that school, but to other variables, so naturally, larger studentship in a particular school will average at a lower per-student average budget. What this table seems to show is that students in schools with larger amount of students inscripted seem to be perfroming better than students in small schools (although that may translate in higher budget per student).\n",

    "Verified... Smaller size schools have systematically better student performance than large schools.  Small size studentship schools are charter schools in general. Those schools have independence to define their curriculum as well as giving more hours of classess and defining a maximum amount of students enrolled in their programs. Consequently, those schools have better perfromance per student. One may think... those charter schools may be located in better well-off neighbourhoods, and their studentship may come from upper well-educated socio-economic groups. Such conditions immediately translate into higher perfromance per student. \n",
    "Contrary, district schools are less but have massive studentship. Large studentship may cause that teachers are less individually focused and dedicated into the success of their particular students. Students from district schools may also come from tougher neighbourhoods , or there might be other reasons why large studenship schools (district schools in most cases) have systematically worst perfromance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Budget allocation is not directly related, but contrary to that, small size schools (notably charter schools) have less budget allocation on average (both in absolute terms and per-student). This means that there is not a direct correlation between student perfromance and budget allocation in the short term, and that budget allocation is not proportional to students per school. The higher budget in low performing schools may be a result of a particular education policy developed by the school district office  with the objective or reverting the trend, but the results will only be visible in some years time. \n",
